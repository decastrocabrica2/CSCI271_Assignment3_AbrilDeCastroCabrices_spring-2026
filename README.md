#Finding the complexity for each algorithm

#Question 1

### In question 1 we were tasked to find the length of a string using recursion.
### first the function checks if the string is empty, if its not then it will call itself
### and proccess one charcter at a time.
### so the time complexity is T(n) = O(n)
### because its making one recursive call per character
